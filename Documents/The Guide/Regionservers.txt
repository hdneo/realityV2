Regionservers have been responsible for a lot of important things over the years.
There was a buff stacking exploit based on regionserver lines, and duping
occurs on spontaneous regionserver crashes (no longer with scheduled shutdowns).

To "find someone" quickly in MXO, such as a live event, you just need to find
what regionserver they're on. Use this list to minimize the hardlines you need to
visit. Once you have the regionserver narrowed down, a looping /who, /target, and 
waypoint macro will do the trick.
